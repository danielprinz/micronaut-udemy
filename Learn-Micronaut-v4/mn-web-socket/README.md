# Web Sockets
This project is a showcase for using Web Sockets in Micronaut.

## Quotes Example
The application is based on a quotes server for stocks.

Clients can connect to a quotes server via websockets to receive live updates on relevant stocks. Each client can specify the stocks he's interested in and only receives updates for these.
